Jessica and Al,

In this message I attach the coordinates for the ETP strata used in the STAR cruises.  The files are simple lat/lon text files with decimal values.  The names are mostly self-explanatory but there is additional text within each file.  If the name starts with "Area", the coordinates form a closed polygon, or a series of closed polygons, so that the enclosed area can be computed.  If the name starts with "Bound" the coordinates do not form a closed polygon, but only show the water boundary.  These boundary files are more useful for mapping.

Following messages will contain files for other cruises.

I think these sets are complete, but have not plotted them to confirm this.  Let me know if you think any files are missing.

Al, please archive these files so that they will be safe!

The cruises from 1976-1983 sampled various areas which changed each year.  In the early years they were largely exploratory as we developed consistent methods.  The files here were used in the Gerrodette & Forcada 2005 paper.
